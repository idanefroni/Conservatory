This program computes for the K2P model, when two sequences are given, the ML distance and its likelihood.

For Tr/Tv = 0.5
 the likelihood of these 2 sequences is:-10.515
 the ML distance between these 2 sequences is:0.823959

For Tr/Tv = 10
 the likelihood of these 2 sequences is:-8.70737
 the ML distance between these 2 sequences is:0.857854
